Typescript types for food data central api schema definitions

This repo is an attempt to create typescript types for schema and path definitions found at https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/fdcnal/food-data_central_api/1.0.1

The only out-of-the-box file is fdc-api-types.ts.  It should conform to the fdc api.  However, the actual responses for the calls on the site do <b>not</b> conform to the declared schemas.  The other files in this repo are attempts to provide types to the actual responses.
